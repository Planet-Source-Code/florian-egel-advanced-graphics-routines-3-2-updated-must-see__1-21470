### Description

Advanced Graphics Routines 3.2 is a Powerful, extremely fast collection of graphic routines that matches industrial standards.<br>I wrote the main code in a C++ - dll, though it would be theoretically possible to write all the Code in pure VB, but VB is just to slow; this way is easier to use and much faster.<br>

<br>

This is a Completely Updated Version of the very successful, contest-winning predecessor, I improved all old functions and added many new ones.<br>

<br>

UPDATE 3.2 (3/6/2001):<br>

- New functions (listed below)<br>

- Increased readability of code<br>

- Improved GUI<br>

<br>

List of Graphical Functions:<br>

- Chrome (new 3.2)</b><br>

- Aluminium (new 3.2)<br>

- Hue rotation (new 3.2)<br>

- Saturation Adjustment (new 3.2)<br>

- Contrast Adjustment (new 3.2)<br>

- Brightness Adjustment (fixed 3.2)<br>

- Alpha Mask (new 3.0)<br>

- Mosaic Filter (new 3.0)<br>

- Relief (new 3.0)<br>

- Blur (new 3.0)<br>

- Invert (new 3.0)<br>

- Outline (new 3.0)<br>

- Flip (new 3.0)<br>

- New Masked Draw (new 3.0)<br>

- AlphaBlending<br>

- Bump Mapping<br>

- Rotating<br>

- Anti-Aliasing<br>

<br>

All functions can be controlled by these Parameters:<br>

- FlipX/Y<br>

- Invert<br>

- Greyscale<br>

- Use Mask Color<br>

- Anti-Alias<br>

<br>

<br>

The effects are realtime even for large pictures like 640x480.<br>

Furthermore the new package contains some useful TIMER/COUNTER functions, that are very useful for example for realtime-programming.<br>

I included some easy samples in VB and a complete VB-Demo to show all the possibilities of the library.<br>

<br>

I hope you like the product, and if so *please* vote for this really useful and extremely fast code! Feedback would be appreciated, too.<br>

<br>

Sincerely, Florian Egel<br>
